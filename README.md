# python-utils
Python tooling for data analysis and a few ad-hoc scripts related with faktaoklimatu.cz
- most scripts are not expected to work out of the box, as they depends on various datasets and try import more than is needed
- 2020-03-28_co2-vs-gdp-generovani-grafu.py is an example script with data included in the repo
- plotting with multiple "plot pages" in a single one does not work out of the box either, see the comment in libs/plots.py
- for viewing dataframes, it's handy to have Tad installed and set as a default viewer for CSV files - https://www.tadviewer.com/
